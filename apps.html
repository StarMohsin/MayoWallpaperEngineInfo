    <h1>Application Executables</h1>
    <p>
        Mayo Wallpaper Engine can set any application as desktop wallpaper
        , though the application needs to listen for window messages sent by 
        the wallpaper engine , these messages contains info about events,
        though Mayo Wallpaper Engine sends mouse events and keyboard events as 
        messages by default. This means any one can create their own media player
        to play videos, or set a game created using Unity or anyother engine as wallpaper.
