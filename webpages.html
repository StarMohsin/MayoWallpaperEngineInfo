            Mayo Wallpaper Engine is capable of running webpages as a web browser,
            though this is still in development due to many difficulties faced when
            creating a custom browser that can handle user input behind the desktop window.
            The mouse events work fine in webpages, though Cascading Style Sheets don't
            work properly as they heavly rely on live user input.

            The wallpaper engine can handle web pages like a browser. So yeah
            , you can use html file or even a link to make this work.
